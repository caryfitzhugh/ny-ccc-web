For each potential solution, assess the anticipated costs and risks, as well as the anticipated benefits from implementing it.

                The final step in building resilience is to take action. Put your plan into place, establish benchmarks, and track progress. Revise at regular intervals as necessary. Understanding how to communicate your plan with stakeholders can help build and maintain support.
