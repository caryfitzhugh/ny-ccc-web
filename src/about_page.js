            <h1>THREEPIO</h1>
            <p>I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be 
            important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work 
            if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know they're starting to 
            nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before 
            your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.</p>

            <h2>Things always change.</h2>
            <p>The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange 
            foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures 
            fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock 
            canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he 
            goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for 
            a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.</p>

            <h2> EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET</h2>
            <p>In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall 
            and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little 
            further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a 
            pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the 
            narrow path.</p>

            <h4>INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA</h4>
            <p>It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo 
            switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles 
            around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty 
            metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and 
            maimed astro-robots. </p>

            <h4>THREEPIO</h4>
            <p> The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent 
            twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain 
            ridge. </p>

            <h4>EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES</h4>
            <p>Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, 
             creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  
             Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights 
             pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long 
             chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding 
             white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the 
             odd assortment of robots.</p>

            <h4>THREEPIO</h4>
            <p>The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening 
            them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. 
            The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting 
            small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils 
            should be.</p>

            <h2>THREEPIO</h2>
            <p> Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, 
               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are 
               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully 
               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- 
               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little 
               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales 
               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.</p>

            <h2>EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON</h2>

            <h2>About us</h2>

            <h4>LUKE</h4>
            <p> The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked 
            out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract 
            attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps 
            Luke on the shoulder.</p>
            <p>
            Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very 
            pleased with that one, sir. He really 
            is in first-class condition. I've 
            worked with him before. Here he comes.</p>

            <h4>INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON</h4>
            <p>
              The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful 
              atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers 
              himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the 
              battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery 
              with a cord to his face.
